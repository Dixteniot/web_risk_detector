## Introduction.

Few decades ago End Users had full control on what JavaScript could do on their computers.
All they had to do was to disable or enable JavaScript on their web browsers.
Most new web browsers no longer have that option any more.
The decision to remove those options is obvious, most new web pages simply can't work properly without JavaScript. From web security point of view, JavaScript is one of those things that you can't live with it and you can't live without it. In the beginning, it was very simply to get the JavaScript that you want only. The users had to visit that web page in a safe environment and get what they want only. The world wide web is no longer a safe environment as it used to be. It is full of risk and tricks. Things like the man in the middle attacks, spoofing attacks, DOS (Denial Of Service) attacks, etc.
